<p>There are two ways to access a property: object.property or object["property"]</p>

<!-- the p element containing an id called demo only -->
<p id="demo"></p>

// the single-line comment below that is instructing me to create an object of any sort
// Create an Object:

// the person variable/object (declared by the const keyword) that is assigned an array of 3 different properties with their own assigned values which are each firstName being "John", lastName being "Doe", and id being 5566
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id     :  5566
};

// the single-line comment below that is saying for me to display the lastname property of it's own assigned value from the person object
// Display lastName from the Object:

// the line of code in particular inside of the opening and closing script tags that is telling the browser of this current document/webpage to print out the string value wrapped in double quotes and the object["property"] being person["lastName"] of it's own value that are each being put together by the + operator into a new string that'll be printed out into the HTML element being the p element containing an id called demo
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The last name is " +  person["lastName"];
