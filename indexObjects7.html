// Create an Object:

// the person variable/object (declared by the const keyword) that is assigned an array that has 3 different properties with their own assigned values inside of it with each being called firstName being "John", lastName being "Doe", and id being 5566
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id     :  5566
};

// the single-line comment below that is telling me to display the lastName property of it's assigned value from the person object
// Display lastName from the Object:

// the particular line of code being inside of the opening and script tags that is telling the browser of this document/webpage to print out the specific string value wrapped in double quotes and the object.property being person.lastName that are each being put together by the + operator into a new string that'll be printed out into the HTML element being the p element containing an id called demo
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The last name is " + person.lastName;
